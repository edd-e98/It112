  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Eddie. I am currently a student at SCCC working to get my associates degree in web development, with a focus on database development. I also work part-time at a local pottery store. In my spare time, I like to play Dungeons and Dragons, and I perform in local drag shows with my friends.</p>
